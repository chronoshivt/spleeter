# Starter for deploying apps on [Render](https://render.com)

This small, full stack application integrates a Deep Learning model by [Deezer](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) and makes it a REST endpoint that can be used to separate vocals and accompaniment from an audio file. 

It follows [fast.ai's](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) to deploy apps on Render. It's been modified accordingly for this application.

You can select an audio file and separate the vocals and accompaniment. The vocals/accompaniment will be downloaded by your web browser and the original file will not be saved anywhere.

You can test your changes locally by doing the following:

1. `git clone https://github.com/theccalderon/separate-stems.git`
2. `cd separate-stems`
3. `docker build -t separate-stems . && docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 separate-stems`

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.
